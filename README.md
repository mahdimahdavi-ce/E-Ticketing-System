# E-Ticketing-System
This project is the final project of Software Engineering couse at SBU. In this project, I had the chance to implement a real-world system that
intended to simulate an online system for selling tickets for buses, trains, and airplanes.
Some of the technologies that I've used in this project are:

- Node.js
- Nest.js
- Typescript
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma
- Swagger
